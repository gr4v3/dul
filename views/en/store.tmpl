    <p>The visual art of the Dul and Nouk White album cover, was designed by the artist SÃ­lvio Pita, and addresses, by
        detail, the entire three-dimensional plane of existence which includes the five interpreting organisms that
        form the core of the project. The Life process is represented here as an infinite cycle, where the Cosmos is
        place of beginning and end, thus merging the neural zone of the interior of the earth, where the
        mycelia, roots and seeds, with the expanded Universe, from where we came and where we will return, place
        where all the basic components for the development of Life on Earth are found.</p>

    <p>The tree is represented here as the living being that traverses the three planes of existence, and that contributes,
        actively, in the decomposition and conception of the concept that we have of Life, taking it dispersed at the ends of our
        its branches towards the heavens, catapulting us, again, towards the end that is also a beginning.</p>
